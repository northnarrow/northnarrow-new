# Capability program (Wave 4)

From 2026-10-20 NorthNarrow grows capability by capability towards level 3
("extended or mature") on the thirty capabilities below. This file is the
program's tracker: each lab PR adds one note at the end, with the capability
it moves, what was verified in the lab and what is still open.

Levels, as self-assessed from the code and the lab, never from marketing:

- **0** absent;
- **1** limited or partial;
- **2** present, tested in the lab;
- **3** extended or mature: complete, documented, with negative tests, verified
  in the lab on every supported kernel. Where a capability's level 3 needs
  something only a third party can give (independent validation, a platform
  vendor's entitlement or driver signature), the note says so and the level
  stays below 3 until it exists.

No note claims an effect that was not measured. A capability's level changes
only in the table below, in the same PR as the evidence.

## Capabilities

| ID | Capability | Level (2026-10-20) | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| C01 | Linux sensor | 2 | 3 |
| C02 | Windows sensor | 0 | 3 (user-mode first; a kernel driver needs WHCP signing) |
| C03 | macOS sensor | 0 | 3 (needs Apple's Endpoint Security entitlement) |
| C04 | ARM64 support | 0 | 3 |
| C05 | Process telemetry | 1 | 3 |
| C06 | File telemetry and FIM | 2 | 3 |
| C07 | Endpoint network telemetry | 1 | 3 |
| C08 | Identity and ITDR | 0 | 3 |
| C09 | Cloud telemetry and posture | 0 | 3 |
| C10 | Network detection (NDR) | 0 | 3 |
| C11 | Containers and Kubernetes | 1 | 3 |
| C12 | Synchronous inline blocking | 1 | 3 |
| C13 | Malware prevention | 0 | 3 |
| C14 | Behavioural detection and correlation | 2 | 3 |
| C15 | Custom rules, declarative format | 1 | 3 |
| C16 | Structured ATT&CK mapping | 1 | 3 |
| C17 | Response on processes and files | 2 | 3 |
| C18 | Host network isolation | 1 | 3 |
| C19 | Rollback and remediation | 1 | 3 |
| C20 | Automation, playbooks, SOAR | 1 | 3 |
| C21 | SIEM integration and export | 0 | 3 |
| C22 | Backend and multi-host correlation | 0 | 3 |
| C23 | Anti-tamper and self-defence | 2 | 3 |
| C24 | Offline and air-gapped operation | 2 | 3 |
| C25 | Data sovereignty | 2 | 3 |
| C26 | Open code, licence, inspectability | 2 | 3 |
| C27 | Product supply-chain security | 1 | 3 |
| C28 | Safe content release | 1 | 3 |
| C29 | Independent public validation | 0 | 3 (needs third parties) |
| C30 | Generative AI and data governance | 2 | 3 |

## Order

1. Correct before extending: the defects a static review of `baf4c25` found
   that are still on `main` (BPF command constants, watchdog exit status,
   COMBAT outcomes, upgrade rollback, boot phases and signed degradations,
   ATT&CK identifiers).
2. Linux telemetry (C05, C06, C07, C11), then prevention (C12, C13, C17, C18),
   detection (C14, C15, C16), integration and backend (C19–C22, C24, C28),
   platforms (C01, C04, then C02), product trust (C25–C27, C29, C30).
